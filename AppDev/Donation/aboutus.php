             <h3><a href="#">Our Mandate</a></h3>
               <p>Mandates describe what your agency has to do based on the programs and services it has formally contracted to offer as well as federal, provincial, and local laws, codes, and regulations. Mandates can be expressed formally or informally through written contracts and business plans, community or group expectations, policies, procedures, and partnership agreements. It would be very short-sighted to produce a wonderful strategic plan only to discover that there was not enough time or resources left over to fulfill your contracted services.</p>

             <h3><a href="#">Our Plans</a></h3>
               <p>
               We believe challenges like the ones Nigeria faces, should not exist in any part of the world.


Lasting change in every community happens when people have access to social amenities, quality health care system, sound education, economic empowerment and necessary support to escape poverty. If these are well structured and implemented it will strengthen them and also give them the courage to love and support one another.


At Helpers Social Development Foundation, these are what our founding members are working on to achieve with the support of our volunteers, partners, spirited individuals who year after year invest in lives rather than using their wealth alone.
